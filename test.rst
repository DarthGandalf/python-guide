Missing test files in PyPI packages
===================================
One of the more common test-related problems is that PyPI packages
(generated via ``setup.py sdist``) often miss some or all test files.
The latter results in no tests being run, the former in test failures
or errors.

The simplest solution is to use a VCS snapshot instead of the PyPI
tarball:

.. code-block:: bash

    # pypi tarballs are missing test data
    #SRC_URI="mirror://pypi/${PN:0:1}/${PN}/${P}.tar.gz"
    SRC_URI="https://github.com/${PN}/${PN}/archive/${PV}.tar.gz -> ${P}.gh.tar.gz"
